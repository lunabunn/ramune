# :lemon: ramune ![](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/lunabunn/ramune/Rust)

Another opinionated 2D game framework for Rust.

> :warning: **Ramune is still in *very* early stages of development!** There are probably tons of bugs, undocumented APIs, and missing features. Unless you're willing to "live on the edge," you shouldn't use it for any serious projects. In the meantime, please still feel free to give it a spin just for fun! Bug reports and suggestions are greatly welcome.

## Goals

- A simple, easy to use, and Rusty API inspired by projects like [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) and [Processing](https://processing.org/)
- Fast compile times with minimal dependencies
- Cross-platform support with no (or minimal) changes to user code
- Hardware-accelerated graphics with OpenGL

## Non-Goals

- Micro-optimizations or optimizations that require sacrificing API usability
- 3D or lower-level capabilities
- A general-purpose, non-opinionated API
