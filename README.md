# :lemon: ramune

Another opinionated 2D game framework for Rust.

> :warning: **Ramune is still in very early stages of development!** There are probably tons of bugs, undocumented APIs, and missing features. As such, you really shouldn't use it for serious projects. In the meantime though, please still feel free to give it a spin just for fun! Bug reports and suggestions are super welcome.

## Goals

- A simple, easy to use, and Rusty API inspired by projects like [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) and [Processing](https://processing.org/)
- Fast compile times with minimal dependencies
- Cross-platform support with no—or minimal—changes to user code
- Hardware-accelerated graphics with lemon (dedicated graphics abstraction layer)

## Non-Goals

- Micro-optimizations or optimizations that require sacrificing API usability
- A non-opinionated API
